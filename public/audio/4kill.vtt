during an attack in Alabama late last

5
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.519
night CNN's Isabel Rosales who's in the

6
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.380
city of Dadeville where the shooting

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.059
happened so Isabelle thank you for

8
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.980
joining us what more can you tell us

9
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.720
yeah good afternoon to you Hillary this

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.460
is Dadeville a small tight-knit

11
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.220
community of just 3 000 people it's just

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.399
45 miles Northeast of Montgomery Alabama

13
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.739
and out here in the downtown area you

14
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.960
can see it's still pretty active we have

15
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
a yellow police tape blocking off the

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
immediate area by this venue behind me

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.879
where the shooting happened this brick

18
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.460
building is a dance studio we are told

19
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.280
by a witness a sweet 16th birthday party

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
was happening here just yesterday after

21
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.699
10 30 p.m we're told by law enforcement

22
00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.059
is when the shots ring out that shooting

23
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.879
occurred we are told by officers that so

24
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.400
far four people are confirmed dead and a

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
quote multitude of injuries have

26
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.540
happened but very important to hear

27
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.299
Hillary there is no Public Safety

28
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.119
concern at this time that is what the

29
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.280
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is saying

30
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.320
however they are not releasing details

31
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680
as to who this shooter is and whether

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.840
they have been apprehended I did speak

33
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.060
with a pastor here a senior pastor for

34
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
the church Dr Ben Hayes who's also the

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.220
chaplain for the police department and a

36
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.780
chaplain for the local High School's

37
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.159
football team so he's at the

38
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.479
intersection of a lot of information

39
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.400
here in the community and he told me

40
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.860
that he got that call last night from

41
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.140
the police chief asking him to go to the

42
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.020
hospital where those hurt survivors are

43
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.600
being sent to he went there and consoled

44
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.759
students who were so frightened by what

45
00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.500
had happened what they witnessed in

46
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.960
front of them and parents of the victims

47
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.079
he said that they were just shocked he

48
00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.540
was taken aback by the lack of Tears he

49
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.040
says that they were numb to this

50
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.020
situation seemingly unable to process

51
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.719
what they witnessed he also told me

52
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.399
Hayes told me that he knew one of the

53
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.380
victims one of those four victims he

54
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.959
says was a football player for the local

55
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.420
high school we do know from the

56
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.280
superintendent here in the district that

57
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.620
they will be bringing in counselors to

58
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.540
help these children go through this

59
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.700
grieving process us and understand what

60
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.640
happened here we do also know that over

61
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.680
in the nation's capital the White House

62
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.140
tells us that President Biden has been

63
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.540
briefed as to this shooting the White

64
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.520
House is closely monitoring the

65
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.500
situation and has been in touch with

66
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.239
local officials and law enforcement

67
00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.700
offering their support and Hillary if I

68
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.920
can also say that this the U.S has

69
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.180
suffered at least 162 mass shootings in

70
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.840
the first 15 weeks of 2023 that is an

71
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.840
average of one and a half mass shootings

72
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.560
per day this happening on the same day

73
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.019
over in Louisville Kentucky where shots

74
00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.140
were fired into a crowd at a park

75
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.959
killing two and injuring four so so many

76
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.300
questions here in this community about

77
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.879
what happened here but frankly in the

78
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.819
nation overall wondering why this

79
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.360
continues to happen day after day hello

80
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.700
some staggering numbers Isabel but we do

81
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.500
